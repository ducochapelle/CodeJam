07/12: HHI/Doris understood to be on verge of winning this contract. Doris is finalising subcontracts for engineering to local companies, including NETCO and International Energy Services.

04/12: Final two bidders have put in their revised bids after local content requirement was increased. Nigerian government have asked Total to increase its local content by 50%. Significant cost increase expected.

02/12: Only two bidders left in the race after Technip was disqualified. Understood to be on the grounds that its local content bid was based on a reimbursable offer and not lump sum, as Total wanted. Hyundai is the favourite now, as it has successfully built FPSOs for Total. Nigeria wants 17,000 tonnes of topsides built in the country, which is likely to increase the FPSO's cost by around 25%.
