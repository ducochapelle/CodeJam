05/10: The Bulgarian government has requested that additional feasibility studies be carried out on the proposed conversion of the Galata gas field into a storage facility.

07/08: Melrose Resources and Bulgargaz have concluded that the Galata field in the Black Sea is ideally suited for conversion to a gas storage scheme, and intend to carry out the first phase of work during 2009.  Joint feasibility studies have confirmed that the high quality reservoir properties, existing infrastructure and location mean that Galata is suited for use as a gas storage reservoir. The first phase of development will require an investment of around USD 30 million to reconfigure the existing field compression, tie-back the suspended Galata East No.2 well and install additional metering facilities. This first phase would provide usable storage capacity of around 25 billion scf of gas. Phases two and three would each require similar levels of investment to the first phase and would increase the capacity to 42 billion scf and 60 billion scf of gas respectively."

Partner Lotos does not expect production to start until the third quarter of 2015. PSA says ""a considerable amount of work remains before the development of the Yme field is completed.""

10/12: PSA has issued Talisman with questions about the likelihood of structural collapse and subsequent loss of the platform, if the cracks in the foundation are not fixed before winter. It is thought that Talisman will need to secure the platform in order to be sure it will withstand the coming autumn and winter storms. Assessment report has still not been released.

09/12: Assessment report regarding the MOPUstor platform has still not been released. It is being prepared by DNV and Atkins.

07/12: Talisman is understood to be working with Aker Solutions towards finding a solution to the problems that are plaguing the platform.

07/12: Sources suggest a new plan for development and operation will have to be submitted for this project, due to significant deviations or changes to the original plan. In March 2012, the project was around 35% complete, well short of the original schedule which was for it to be around 70% complete.

3/12: Unconfirmed reports suggest a great deal of work remains to be done on the platform. Breakdown in communication between SBM and Talisman is understood to be a factor.

2/12: Talisman has taken the project out of its production figures for 2012, but would not commit to a new production date. 
2/12: It is understood that the resonance frequency of the MOPUstor platform is high and that waves of a certain frequency could cause damage to the platform.

1/12: Delays continue with project, which is cautiously predicted to start up in mid-2012. Talisman says competence of contractor  is stretched. 

7/11: start-up date pushed to the end of the first half of 2012. Talisman blames the delay on poor fabrication of MOPUstor by the Topaz yard.
