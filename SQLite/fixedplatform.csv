In the first phase, the platform consists of three modules. Large sections of the weather decks on these modules have been designed so as to enable future installation of EOR (enhanced oil recovery) modules and/or handle increased production from future development phases.

By converting this existing out-of-use oil and gas structure into a receiving terminal for the re-gasification of LNG, the environmental impact will be benign, and the project will have a faster construction schedule, setting Clearwater Port to be first to market.

The existing platform will be refurbished and reconfigured for LNG re-gasification, with two floating mooring docks added that are capable of accommodating large LNG ships. Construction is set for 2008, with commercial operation by 2009. The platform will be connected through a 28-mile pipeline to the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) pipeline network and storage infrastructure."
