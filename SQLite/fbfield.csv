10/08: Lundin Petroleum believes that recoverable reserves from its share of the Morskaya field in the Caspian Sea could be as much as 450 million barrels of oil.  Preliminary estimates indicate that the gross recoverable reserves will be between 110 million barrels and 450 million barrels, with the mid case estimate placed at around 230 million barrels. Around half of the Morskaya field is located in the Lagansky block, with the mid case estimate placing the size of the discovery at close to 500 million barrels of oil. Further appraisal drilling will be needed to assess the full extent of the reservoirs. A first appraisal well is planned for 2009, while acquisition of 3D seismic data is underway. Lundin currently has a 70 per cent interest in the Lagansky block, but Gazprom has a call option to acquire a 50 per cent plus one share stake. Lundin has a call option to acquire an additional 30 per cent from minority shareholders. If both options are exercised, Lundin will retain 50 per cent minus one share in the Lagansky block and Gazprom will hold a 50 per cent plus one share stake. The Morskaya discovery was made in July 2008, the well testing at a combined flow rate of 2,500 b/d of 32 API oil.

07/08: Testing of Lundin Petroleum's Morskaya-1 exploration well on the Lagansky block in the northern Caspian has seen a combined flow rate of 2,500 b/d of 32 API oil.  Two drill stem tests were conducted, the first testing at a stabilised rate of 1,700 b/d through a 56/64-in choke. The second tested at a stabilised rate of 8,000 b/d through a 36/64-in choke. Due to time constraints, the shallower gas-bearing reservoir will be tested in future appraisal wells. Lundin believes that larger rates will be possible when the field is developed."

F3-FA,Northwest Europe,Netherlands,F3,F3-FA,Centrica,Production,Gas,28 Jan 2011,45,"03/08: Development of the F3-FA gas discovery, offshore Netherlands, is likely to be by means of a subsea completion and tie-back to nearby host infrastructure, with offshore processing likely to be carried out on a newbuild mobile platform.  Venture Production, which has acquired its interest in the discovery through a transaction with NAM, says that the development plan is likely to see a new limited manning mobile self-installing production platform built. This platform would have all the necessary processing and gas compression capability to deliver dry gas and condensate directly into the export pipeline, removing the need for use of third party topsides processing. The platform would be reusable for production of stranded gas assets across the southern North Sea. Venture anticipates that F3-FA would be onstream by 2011. F3-FA sits in a water depth of 45 msw around 20km east of the F3-FB platform and 23km northeast of the F2a-Hanze platform. The F3-1 well, drilled in 1971, and the F3-8 well, drilled in 1982, discovered a gas condensate accumulation lying predominantly in Block F3 with an extension into Block B18a. Following unitisation of the field across the two blocks, Venture will hold a 58 per cent operated interest in F3-FA. It is believed that the field contains reserves of around 60 billion scf of gas."

Block Q/7 includes the Q/7-1 gas discovery, which is estimated to contain between 20 billion and 40 billion scf of recoverable gas. Well Q/7-1 was drilled by NAM in 1973 and tested at 11.5 million scf/d from a 35-metre interval. The gas was of high quality, containing only small amounts of inert gas and no hydrogen sulphide. In addition to the gas accumulation in the block, a number of undrilled leads at potential reservoir horizons have been mapped, and will be further evaluated. The work programme for the near future includes reprocessing of the existing seismic data base and remapping of the acreage.

Bonneville prospect is located four kilometres south of the Burgman discovery on the Catcher licence in the UK Central North Sea.  

The Bonneville well was drilled to a total depth of 4,481 feet true vertical depth subsea (TVDSS). The well encountered a gross oil column of 66 vertical feet in the Tay interval with an estimated net oil pay of 26 feet. The Bonneville well was subsequently sidetracked to the Bonneville East prospect. The sidetrack was drilled to a total depth of 4,441 feet TVDSS and encountered 34 feet of net oil pay in an overall gross oil column of 175 vertical feet in the Tay interval.

The well completion phase will include installation of the subsea wellhead and tree and it will then be flow tested to acquire detailed gas and condensate figures to allow for final design modifications to the host Waveney platform. Flow testing of the well is expected to be complete within the next few weeks. As previously reported, Durango will be developed as a single well 14.3km tie-back to Waveney, with Technip undertaking installation in September ahead of first gas in October.


02/08: Bridge Resources has begun drilling the production well on its Durango field in Block 48/21a.  Drilling, completion and testing of well 48/21a-4 will take around two months. Bridge Resources, which has a 100 per cent working interest in Durango, previously named Dudgeon, believes the discovery could contain reserves of up to 42.4 billion scf of gas. The well will be tied back 14.3km to the Perenco-operated Waveney platform in Block 48/17c. From there, gas is transported by pipeline to the onshore Bacton processing plant. Durango was first discovered by Placid Oil in 1967, but has remained undeveloped since then.

The announcement has come following the successful completion of the first phase of the appraisal on the multi-zone scheme. The latest findings include an oil column in the Huntington Fulmar oil accumulation of at least 138 metres. A field development plan is expected to be submitted by the middle of 2008.

12/07: Noreco has announced the results of appraisal drilling on the Huntington discovery in Block 22/14b in the UK Central North Sea.  Stem testing of two intervals within Paleocene Forties oil pay yielded maximum flow rates of 2,100 b/d and 5,208 b/d. Drilling operations will commence shortly on the next phase of appraisal drilling at Huntington. This single appraisal well bore will attempt to target the oil/water contact in the Jurassic Fulmar sands on the flank of the structure well below the elevation tested by the discovery well drilled in the second quarter. This well is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. Oilexco, which operates the field, has previously said production is expected to begin by 2009 at the earliest. An additional two wells are to be drilled on the discovery over the next few months.

07/08: FDP expected by end 2009.

03/08: Nautical Petroleum believes that its Kraken discovery in Block 9/2b is ""a substantial accumulation"" that has ""exceeded the predicted maximum pre-drill estimate"".  Having analysed the results from its 9/2b-2 well, which found oil in November 2007, Nautical has described reservoir quality as ""excellent"", with high porosity and permeability. The gravity of recovered oil samples was higher than expected and viscosity was around 110cp or less, similar to that of the producing Captain field. Based on the information from the well, indications are that there could be considerably more oil in place and that the higher API and lower viscosity should increase recovery factors and achieve a higher price per barrel. Nautical plans to drill a horizontal/high angle well to test the production potential of the Kraken field, and will also drill an exploration well on the Hydra prospect, located to the north of Kraken in Block 3/27a.

Gas condensate bearing reservoir sands at a depth of 3,956 metres were drill stem tested, flowing gas at an average rate of 20.3 million scf/d with 2,110 b/d of condensate through a 36/64-in choke. The maximum flow rate achieved during the test was 24.4 million scf/d and 2,460 b/d of condensate, with flow rates severely restricted by the test equipment, working temperatures and pressures encountered. No depletion was measured and no water or sand was produced during the test. Calculations suggest that the Moth well could be capable of producing 44 million scf/d and 4,400 b/d of condensate."

The operator and JV partner Ithaca were awarded the southern area through an Out of Round (OOR) Licence application in the first quarter of this year after BP and its partners relinquished it in the fourth quarter of 2013. EnQuest is planning to drill up to two producer and two water injection wells to develop the field. The wells will be drilled from Block 211/18a via the existing drill centres at Don South West. The wells will then be tied back via existing facilities to the Northern Producer FPF and produced for the field's life of around nine years. Water injection and gas lift will be supplied from the Northern Producer via existing pipelines. EnQuest anticipates works to start in the second quarter of 2015 but says that work could start as early as the last quarter of this year. The partner says that due to uncertainties over the volume of oil present at Ythan, the development will be phased with an initial producer. Around eight months later, the operator will drill an injector which will provide data to determine whether it will drill a second producer and injector. Following drilling, well completion and the installation of a xmas tree, the wells will be tied into the existing Don South West pipelines using short jumper flowlines. A control umbilical will be installed between the xmas trees and the Don South West Subsea Distribution Unit."

03/08: Addax Petroleum has completed the successful appraisal of a well offshore Nigeria that has expanded its Kita Marine area.  The KTM-6 well, in OML 123, encountered an aggregate gross oil column of 52.7 metres over four zones. Addax suggests the find opens up the possibility of initiating development and production for the first time in the northern part of OML 123. The KTM-6 appraisal well was drilled 2km to the southwest of the successful KTM-2ST1 exploration well. Both wells penetrated separate but adjacent fault blocks. The KTM-2ST1 well was drilled in late 2005 and encountered an aggregate gross oil column of 30 metres over three main zones and flow tested at 1,000 b/d of 28 degrees API oil. Flow tests were not performed on the KTM-6 well but pressure and fluid sample data indicated medium gravity oil to be present. The Kita Marine area sits in around 10 msw and is around 10km northeast of the North Oron/Oron West production facility."
